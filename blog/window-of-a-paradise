She is sitting on the window of a paradise.  
Looking down at the tiny moving wheels.  
Wondering if she could ever be free to ride.  
Instead of just being hauled behind.

She took on the keys, and ran down the high-rise.  
Just to realize she is stuck in the paradise.  
She banged on the door, and cried for help.  
But people wanted silence, so she shut her voice.

She's wondering if she could leap and fly.  
The thought runs down a shiver inside her spine.  
She wants the freedom to live and not from life.  
But people wanted silence, so she shut her voice.
