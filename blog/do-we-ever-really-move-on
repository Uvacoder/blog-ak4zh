title: Do we ever really move on?

I know you are long gone.  
I know you won’t come along.  
I know I have been there too long.  
I know you have got your groove on.  
But tell me, do we ever really move on?  
Or it's just the mask we put on?

I have been doing this for so long,  
I am drained waiting for the dawn,  
I am tired of being so strong.  
I know you want me to move on.  
I know you want me to sing a new song.  
But, I know nothing gonna improve on.  
Just tell me, do we ever really move on?  
Or it’s just the mask we put on?

I agree you are the queen, and I am just a pawn.  
But remember, a pawn never quits the marathon,  
It advances to the farthest rank or just goes down.  
One day he could be you instead of just a pawn.  
Now that you know it was a perfect con,  
Which you believed to be Babylon.  
Just tell me, do we ever really move on?  
Or it’s just the mask we put on?

Tell me baby, do we ever really move on?  
Or it’s just the mask we put on?
