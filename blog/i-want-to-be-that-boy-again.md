On the lands of the andaman, sitting on a remote beach.  
A little boy playing with the sea-sand caught my attention.  

Building sand sculptures.  
It gets washed away with the waves.  
He builds again.  
This time, faster, to finish before the waves.  

He got cheered up when the waves hit again.  
He jumps, laughs and claps.  
I want to be that boy again.  

He is not worried about anything,  
he gains happiness with the little things.  
I would trade anything to have that inside me.  
I want to be that boy again.  

I want to be care-free.  
I want to feel that happiness.  
I want to be that peaceful.  
I want to be that boy again.
