I always want to be with you.  
Yet I am leaving you all alone.  
I won't tell you the reason.  
But I know you will understand.

You are the one I always needed.  
You are the only one I still need.  
Yet I am leaving you all alone.  
But I know you will understand.  

Every time I will get a chance to choose,  
I will always choose you.  
Except for all the times I didn't.  
Because no one else will,  
But I know you will understand.

I know you are hurt.  
I know it makes your heart stutter.  
But remember, I love you.  
And the one I am punishing is me, not you.  
I know you will understand.

That's all she told me when she left.  
That's all I listen to every time.

What did I respond, you ask?  
I just looked at her and smiled.  
Words can make no difference,  
if you are being told and not asked.

She feels I am laughing at the absurdity of everything she said.  
But that's not true.  
It's not a laugh but a smile.  
You cry, shout and fight if you are hurt.  
But when you are helpless, you smile.

Even though everything is absurd.  
Even though I do not want to understand.  
But, it's okay, I understand :)
