I know you are long gone.<br>
I know you won’t come along.<br>
I know I have been there too long.<br>
I know you have got your groove on.<br>
But tell me, do we ever really move on?<br>
Or it's just the mask we put on?

I have been doing this for so long,<br>
I am drained waiting for the dawn,<br>
I am tired of being so strong.<br>
I know you want me to move on.<br>
I know you want me to sing a new song.<br>
But, I know nothing gonna improve on.<br>
Just tell me, do we ever really move on?<br>
Or it’s just the mask we put on?

I agree you are the queen, and I am just a pawn.<br>
But remember, a pawn never quits the marathon,<br>
It advances to the farthest rank or just goes down.<br>
One day he could be you instead of just a pawn.<br>
Now that you know it was a perfect con,<br>
Which you believed to be Babylon.<br>
Just tell me, do we ever really move on?<br>
Or it’s just the mask we put on?

Tell me baby, do we ever really move on?<br>
Or it’s just the mast we put on?
