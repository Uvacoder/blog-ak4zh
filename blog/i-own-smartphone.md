title: I own a smartphone

I own a smartphone.  
But my phone is without a camera.  
No camera, therefore no desire to click pictures.  
No pictures, so I got nothing to share on social media.

Yes, I own a smartphone.  
But my phone is without social media.

My phone has enough space for a few apps.  
But not too much space to create chaos.  
I got Telegram because I want to.  
I got WhatsApp because I have to.  
For all other apps, web browser does a great job.

No one ever calls me,  
Because I don’t receive phone calls.

A smartphone wants to do a lot of things,  
except being just a phone,  
and I hate that.

Yes, I own a smartphone,  
But one day I won’t.
