Why am I writing this post?
Why do I even have a blog?
Does anyone even read what I write?
I don’t know.

Do I want to write?
I don’t know.

Maybe I just want to sleep.
Maybe I just want some peace.

I am still, I am silent, I am blank,
I am empty inside.
My eyes are closed, my fan is off,
there’s no voice, there’s no noise.

I see some darkness,
and I see someone standing in the dark.
Maybe it’s me.
How do I see, even though my eyes are closed?
I don’t know.

I see, that someone is breathing,
breathing in; breathing out.
I can hear the breathing,
I can feel the warmth.
Why is he breathing?
I don’t know.

I see him working,
he works, he sleeps,
he wakes up, he works.
Why does he work?
I don’t know.

Is he working to make money?
What will he do with the money?
I don’t know.

What is the purpose of anything I see?
What is the purpose of anything I write?
Why is that someone still alive?
What is the purpose of work?
What is the purpose of life?
I don’t know.

Honestly, I don’t know anything.
Why do we work to earn some papers, and exchange those for food and land?
We can just live on wild land and grow our own food.
Why do we need someone to love us?
Don’t we love ourselves enough?
What is the purpose of anything in life?
I don’t know.

Maybe I just want to sleep.
Maybe I just want some peace.
Maybe that’s the purpose of everything.
Maybe that’s all that matters.
But, I don’t know.

My eyes are closed, my fan is off,
there’s no voice, there’s no noise,
But I can’t sleep.
I don’t have peace.
Why? I don’t know.
