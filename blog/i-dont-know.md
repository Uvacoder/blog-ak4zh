Why am I writing this post?<br>
Why do I even have a blog?<br>
Does anyone even read what I write?<br>
I don’t know.

Do I love to write?<br>
I don’t know.

Maybe I just want to sleep.<br>
Maybe I just want some peace.

I am still, I am silent, I am blank,<br>
I am empty inside.<br>
My eyes are closed, my fan is off,<br>
there’s no voice, there’s no noise.<br>

I see some darkness,<br>
and I see someone standing in the dark.<br>
Maybe it’s me.<br>
How do I see, even though my eyes are closed?<br>
I don’t know.<br>

I see, that someone is breathing,<br>
breathing in; breathing out.<br>
I can hear the breathing,<br>
I can feel the warmth.<br>
Why is he breathing?<br>
I don’t know.

I see him working,<br>
he works, he sleeps,<br>
he wakes up, he works.<br>
Why does he work?<br>
I don’t know.

What is the purpose of anything I see?<br>
What is the purpose of anything I write?<br>
Why is that someone still alive?<br>
What is the purpose of work?<br>
What is the purpose of life?<br>
I don’t know.

Maybe I just want to sleep.<br>
Maybe I just want some peace.<br>
Maybe that’s the purpose of everything.<br>
Maybe that’s all that matters.<br>
But, I don’t know.

My eyes are closed, my fan is off,<br>
there’s no voice, there’s no noise,<br>
I still can’t sleep.<br>
Why? I don’t know.

One thing I know for sure is I am finding peace as I write.
