Why am I writing this post?  
Why do I even have a blog?  
Does anyone even read what I write?  
I don’t know.

Do I love to write?  
I don’t know.

Maybe I just want to sleep.  
Maybe I just want some peace.

I'm still, I'm quiet, I'm empty inside.  
My eyes are shut, my fan is off,  
there’s no voice, there’s no noise.  

I see obscurity, and I see somebody in darkness.  
Maybe it’s me.  
How can I see even with my eyes shut?  
I don’t know.  

I see, that someone is breathing,  
breathing in; breathing out.  
I can hear the breathing,  
I can feel the warmth.  
Why is he breathing?  
Why is he alive?  
I don’t know.

I see him working,  
he works, he sleeps,  
he wakes up, he works again.  
Why does he work?  
I don’t know.

What is the purpose of anything I see?  
What is the purpose of anything I write?  
What is the purpose of work?  
What is the purpose of life?  
I don’t know.

Maybe I just want to sleep.  
Maybe I just want some peace.  
Maybe that’s the purpose of life.  
But, I don’t know.

My eyes are shut, my fan is off,  
there’s no voice, there’s no noise,  
I still can’t sleep.  
Why? I don’t know.

One thing I know for sure is I am finding peace as I write.
